Hello, from where did I talk to 112 sir, I had given you the idea, I got in touch, but my Volve has not been repaired yet, he said that we are in a fight right now, we have just come, we will see then, it has not been solved, actually I am not able to reach home, the road in front of my house has been completely broken and I am getting my mother's surgery done and I have to take her home after the surgery, they have made pits there, the people have gone all over the road, I had even told those people that I have to get an operation done, please complete it, please put some soil, I was assured that we will put soil, your big car will pass through, soil was put in it and whatever is there, mounds of soil have been made in it and pits have been dug, so now I have brought it, somehow my car has also broken from below, it has been completely damaged, I am getting the operation done by the doctor sahab, but I don't have any idea how to go home, how will I reach home, there is only one road in our street and they have been doing this at least since November He has been carrying out his digging work from November and it has become May-June today, whereas he is not getting it completed within fifteen days or a month, he is making a way to enter the smart city, please tell them there, tell me a little, I mean he will call his jack and get it done.
