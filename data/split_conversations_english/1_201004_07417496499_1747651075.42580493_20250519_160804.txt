Hello, Namaskar, Dial Exovara madam, I had informed about the accident, I have contacted the police, ah, actually I had contacted sir, but I had complained that they should come to the place where it happened, but those people did not come, rather the people who had hit me also went away and the police people told me to go to the police post and submit the application, if I had to submit the application, I have been standing here for one hour, when did those people go from here, those who hit me, it has been twenty minutes, there is a shop of their clothes in Paltan Bazaar, well, that is why I had complained that they should come to the place where we were standing, because tell me, after how much time had they left from there, they went after half an hour, no one had reached, so then you will go now, you are not going to the police post, I was not standing there to go to the police post, sir, it is not going to be of any use to you, I will go and complain again
