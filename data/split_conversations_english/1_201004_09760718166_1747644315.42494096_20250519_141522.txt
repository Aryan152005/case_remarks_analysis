I am talking since 112, madam I had informed, yes hello hello, yes brother, madam I had informed, at 112 I had received a call from the police, brother a complaint has been made at four in the morning, someone comes to me at eight from there, after that they just did a complete inspection and they left saying that ma'am we will come at 10:30 then we will get the recording etc. from the wellman, then they did not come at all, no one came after eight o'clock, then at 10:30 I got a call from the police station, from this outpost, I told them the whole thing, they said okay madam I will come just now, after that no one has come till now, then just now at one:30 then I called those whose call came to me at 10:30 I said brother you have not come since then, I mean brother we are worried since night, whether someone has slept or something, is there any issue, they said no ma'am my duty is here and there ma'am I will see now, I will see till evening, no action is taken like this brother, then everyone's complaint remains like this It is that hey if something happened to you then why did you not complain to the police immediately, for this reason I don't feel like complaining because it just remains on the phone, Bhaiya, I just informed you but nothing came on call, you have not received anything, Bhaiya, then I hit my hand and called again at 112 that ma'am you should take some action, send someone, this is a laughing stock, Bhaiya, someone broke the glass in the neighborhood and went away, there is a thief in front of my eyes, I am calling and no action is being taken against me, so how wrong is this, Bhaiya, you tell me, there are two thieves in front of my eyes, wearing masks, I am talking to them, there complaint is being made on the phone and still no one is coming, so more than this, Bhaiya, it is very wrong, where are you calling from now, Bhaiya, you please get this thing done, it is a lot of our concern, please call once, Bhaiya, because Bhaiya, my children are small, even at night I will not be able to sleep until these things are solved. Understand that you are right madam, it's okay brother please get this done, thank you so much, onkay onkay
